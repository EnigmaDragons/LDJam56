Retro Notes:

1. What went well?
- Multiphonix - Every on the music side went as expected.
- Multiphonix - Liked working with Fmod and learning how to do some new things.
- Multiphonix - The teamwork and communication was very smooth.
- Gordy - Overall, not a lot of bugs, had a lot of seasoned people
- Silas - Really skilled team! So much talent! So much experience!
- Silas - I'm really impressed with the scale and scope of what we shipped.
- Jordan - Just about everything! The team was really tight. No ambiguity since there was 1 person for role.
- Jordan - From the concept to the final execution, there never felt like any scrambling or completeness risk.
- Ludmila - Wanted to challenge herself in doing more things in illustator, and that worked well.
- Ludmila - S/O to Silas for being able to integrate effectively
- Ludmila - The team is AMAZING! Very talented.
- Zavix - The kinematic character controller WORKED.
- Zavix - On first night stretch, we already had hero + animations + sounds + game world. 

2. What didn't go well?
- Gordy - The build pipeline vision didn't come together. Was missing some fundamental integration concepts.
- Multiphonix - No slowdowns or stumbling blocks
- Silas - URP post-processing transparency bug was a big showstopper
- Silas - Last-minute performance issues blocked us from shipping WebGL
- Silas - Having the combat playable on Day 3 limited our iterations and progression 
- Jordan - The underworld implementation caused performance issues that we couldn't easily mitigate
- Ludmila - Was caught up in her head and felt nervous
- Ludmila - Fonts were problematic
- Ludmila - It took about halfway through the jam before her own big artistic vision kicked in as owner of the 2D UI art.
- Zavix - Fmod and WebGL struggle. It's terrible for everyone trying to solve that combo.
- Zavix - It wasn't really possible to align the enemy + player progression curves.

3. What lessons can we take moving forward?
- Silas - Need an Fmod project/template. Also documentation on how to make it work
- Silas - Would be nice to have a dedicated Unity Integration Master
- Silas - Pre-research and tooling prep is HUGELY useful
- Gordy - It was hard to juggle QA & Build Engineer role effectively
- Gordy - Pre-work before the jam can help a TON
- Multiphonix - Had a personal project on the backburner with trouble with Fmod + WebGL
- Jordan - Sticking with a pipeline and toolset we know well is useful
- Jordan - Having scripts and foundational elements ready in advance is very useful
- Jordan - The team size was GREAT! 
- Ludmila - It would be valuable to learn Unity implementation
- Zavix - Pre-research and prep. Document keys fixes for future jams.

4. What was your personal favorite part of the jam?
- Gordy - There was no anxiety about whether we would deliver a game, near the Day 1 marker
- Multiphonix - Seeing how much art was created and how great it looked!
- Multiphonix - Being ahead on the music allowed more work on interactivity
- Silas - Seeing the customizable abilities come to life felt AMAZING!
